				<h3>Probability</h3>
				<p>
					Probability is by far my favorite field of math. I like the way it applies to huge amount of things, from high IT solutions like Machine Learning (Data Mining) down to everyday life. Beside clear math, I'm a fan of Monte Carlo method. Sometimes it's much quicker to write short script, and sometimes it's the only way!

				<h3>Graphics and visualizations</h3>
				<p>
					Computer graphics and game development have always been among my main interests and are the greatest career goal. For very long I've been playing with Unreal Engine 4, creating simulators and simple games. Besides creating front-end, I like to go deeper, see and learn how engines works, how to optimize them and use the best way.
